Repository settings (suggested)

Suggested short description (use on GitHub repo settings):

FitLife — a lightweight Java Swing desktop application for managing gym staff, programs, and member bookings (SQLite-backed).

Suggested topics (comma-separated):

java, desktop-app, swing, sqlite, gym-management, fitness, gui

How to apply these settings locally (recommended)

Option A — using GitHub CLI (`gh`) (recommended):

1. Install `gh` if you don't have it: https://github.com/cli/cli#installation
2. Authenticate: `gh auth login`
3. Run these commands from your project folder to set description and topics:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Anjalee Himalki\Desktop\Fitlife"
# set repository description
gh repo edit Anjalee9814/FitLife --description "FitLife — a lightweight Java Swing desktop application for managing gym staff, programs, and member bookings (SQLite-backed)."
# set topics (replace or add as needed)
gh repo edit Anjalee9814/FitLife --add-topic java --add-topic desktop-app --add-topic swing --add-topic sqlite --add-topic gym-management --add-topic fitness --add-topic gui
```

Option B — via GitHub website (manual):

1. Open https://github.com/Anjalee9814/FitLife
2. Click the gear/settings icon (or the 'Edit' button near the repo name) to edit the short description.
3. Click 'Manage topics' (or edit the topics next to the description) and add: java, desktop-app, swing, sqlite, gym-management, fitness, gui

Notes

- If you prefer different wording or a different set of topics, edit this file accordingly and I'll commit the change.
- I cannot change GitHub repository settings from this environment unless the `gh` CLI is installed and authenticated on your machine (I provided the exact commands above so you can run them locally).
